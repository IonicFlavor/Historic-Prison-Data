JS - The app 3 data visualization compares different groups, such as gender and country of origin, with the length of sentence they face. The admissions book data has a section with how long the sentence of a person is, which is where they got their data. The data only shows at a range of sentences for months. You can only look at disparities in sentence between races by a range of months. You can't see the difference of races and compare them with a 1 month sentence and a 12 month sentence at the same time. It would be interesting to see how multiple factors, such as age and number of convictions, relate to the sentence length of an inmate. This data is already available in the admission books.
