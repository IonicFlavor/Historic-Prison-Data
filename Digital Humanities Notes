JS - The app 3 data visualization compares different groups, such as gender and country of origin, with the length of sentence they face. The admissions book data has a section with how long the sentence of a person is, which is where they got their data. The data only shows at a range of sentences for months. You can only look at disparities in sentence between races by a range of months. You can't see the difference of races and compare them with a 1 month sentence and a 12 month sentence at the same time. It would be interesting to see how multiple factors, such as age and number of convictions, relate to the sentence length of an inmate. This data is already available in the admission books.

MZ - Looking at the Descriptions section of the first admissions book, the moral instructors were very anti-Catholic. Catholicism is referred to as "popery" six times, and in other places Catholicism is contrasted with "true religion" ("true religion" requires belief in "regeneration" - I'm not familiar enough with Christianity to guess what this means, does anyone else know?). I'm especially interested in Peter Brill, described as "Jew and Catholic. Deranged and dangerous." - I am unsure how someone can be a Jew and a Catholic at the same time.

MZ @JS - Julius, did you find anything interesting when you ran the comparisons? I can't get the code to run on my own machine yet.
